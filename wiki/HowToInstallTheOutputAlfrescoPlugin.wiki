I assume you have the Kettle folder installed on your file system.

==Step 1 - download and install==

Now, download the AlfrescoPlugin.tar.gz archive from this web-site home page and extract it into this folder:

                          ../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps

E.g.: c:/Kettle/plugins/steps

After archive extraction you should have a path like this:

                  ../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps/*AlfrescoPlugin*

and into the AlfrescoPlugin folder you should have these files:
  * alfrescoicon.png
  * alfrescoplugin.jar
  * plugin.properties
  * plugin.xml

==Step 2 - plugin.properties==

I've developed the plugin to be used with an Alfresco Custom Content-Model. As you know well, a custom content-model is a custom entity used build documents with specific metadata.
For example, you may need to build documents into Alfresco that identifies a car. A car has some specific characteristics and it's very useful to define them as document metadata, specially to be able to perform useful research into Alfresco.

The only file you have to configure is the *plugin.properties*.
This file contains some plugin properties regarding the Alfresco repository and the Alfresco Custom Content model you want to use.
