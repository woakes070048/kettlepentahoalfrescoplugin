I assume you have the Kettle folder installed on your file system.

==Step 1 - download and install==

Now, download the AlfrescoPlugin.tar.gz archive from this web-site home page and extract it into this folder:

                          ../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps

E.g.: c:/Kettle/plugins/steps

After archive extraction you should have a path like this:

                  ../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps/*AlfrescoPlugin*

and into the AlfrescoPlugin folder you should have these files:
  * alfrescoicon.png
  * alfrescoplugin.jar
  * plugin.properties
  * plugin.xml

==Step 2 - plugin.properties==

I developed the plugin in order to be used with an Alfresco Custom Content-Model. As you know well, a custom content-model is a custom entity used build documents with specific metadata.
For example, you may need to build documents into Alfresco that identifies a car. A car has some specific characteristics and it's very useful to define them as document metadata, specially to be able to perform useful research into Alfresco. Then, if I want to typify a document with some specific metadata, I've to define a Custom Content-Model, as an xml file, with custom properties as:
  * carModel
  * carEngine
  * carColour
  * ecc...

Then let's assume you have defined and configured the Custom Content-Model into Alfresco. (I believe the plugin works with standard content-model too...).

Now, the only file you have to configure is the *plugin.properties*.

This file contains some plugin properties regarding the Alfresco repository and the Alfresco Custom Content-Model you want to use:
  * alfresco.custom.property.doc.content=NOTE_RILEVAMENTO

  * alfresco.loading.path=/app\:company_home/app\:user_homes/cm\:SIBECS/cm\:Ritrovamenti

  * alfresco.endpoint.address=http\://localhost\:8080/alfresco/api

  * alfresco.custom.property.title=oggetto

  * alfresco.custom.property.primarykey=codice

  * alfresco.custom.property.doc.description=oggetto

  * alfresco.content.username=admin

  * alfresco.custom.namespace.url=http\://www.sibecs.com/model/content/1.0

  * alfresco.custom.content.type=ritrovamento

  * alfresco.content.password=admin

  * cms.type=alfresco
