I assume you have the Kettle folder installed on your file system.

==Step 1==

Now, download the AlfrescoPlugin.tar.gz archive from this web-site home page and extract it into this folder:

../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps

E.g.: c:/Kettle/plugins/steps

After archive extraction you should have a path like this:

../*<kettle root>*/plugins/steps/*AlfrescoPlugin*

and into the AlfrescoPlugin folder you should have these files:
  * alfrescoicon.png
  * alfrescoplugin.jar
  * plugin.properties
  * plugin.xml
