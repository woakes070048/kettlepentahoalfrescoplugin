I developed a Kettle Pentaho Output Plugin to allow data loading into Alfresco CMS repository as Documents with specific metadata. The plugin works very well, but it lacks of a Graphic User Interface and I think it may be improved in many technical aspects. The plugin is written in Java language and it uses Alfresco Webservices API. Pentaho has not a plugin like this!!! Nobody has never built a plugin to load data into a CMS repository as Alfresco (or others) and an ETL like this is very useful in many professional Information Technology contexts!
